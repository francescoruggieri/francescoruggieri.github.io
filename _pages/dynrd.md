## dynrd

I am finalizing the beta version of **dynrd**, a package for estimating and conducting statistical inference on interpretable causal parameters in dynamic regression discontinuity designs.

Details of the methodology are presented in [**Dynamic Regression Discontinuity: An Event-Study Approach**](/files/DynDisc.pdf).
