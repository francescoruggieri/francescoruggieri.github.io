I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics at the University of Chicago.

My research focuses on topics in public and urban economics, and specifically household valuation of local public goods, efficient property taxation in a system of overlapping jurisdictions, and spatial mobility responses to local tax changes. I am also interested in developing methods for the identification and estimation of causal parameters with a clear economic interpretation.

Prior to graduate school, I worked as a Research Professional at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and at Princeton University. I hold a bachelorís degree in Economics from Universit√ Bocconi and a masterís degree in Economics from the London School of Economics and Political Science.
