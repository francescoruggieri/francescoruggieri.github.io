I am a pre-job-market Postdoctoral Scholar in the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics at the University of Chicago, where I completed my Ph.D. in 2024.

My research lies at the intersection of **public finance** and **urban economics**, with a focus on property taxation and the spatial structure of local governments in the United States. I also develop **econometric methods** of direct relevance to empirical questions in local public finance.

**I am on the 2025-26 academic job market.**
