      I am a pre-job-market Postdoctoral Scholar in the Kenneth C. Griffin Department
      of Economics at the University of Chicago, where I completed my Ph.D. in 2024.
    </p>
    <p>
      My research lies at the intersection of <strong>public finance</strong> and
      <strong>urban economics</strong>, with a focus on property taxation and the
      spatial structure of local governments in the United States. I also develop
      <strong>econometric methods</strong> of direct relevance to empirical questions
      in local public finance.
    </p>
    <p><strong>I am on the 2025-26 academic job market.</strong></p>
