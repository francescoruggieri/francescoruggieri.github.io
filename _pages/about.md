I am a pre-job-market Postdoctoral Scholar in the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics at the University of Chicago, where I completed my Ph.D. in 2024.

My research focuses on topics in public finance and urban economics. I also develop methods for the identification and estimation of causal parameters with a clear economic interpretation.
