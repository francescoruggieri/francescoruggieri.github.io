I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Chicago.

My research focuses on topics in public and urban economics. I also develop methods for the identification and estimation of causal parameters with a clear economic interpretation.

I hold a bachelor's degree in Economics from Universit&agrave; Bocconi and a master's degree in Economics from the London School of Economics and Political Science.
