I am a pre-job-market Postdoctoral Scholar in the Kenneth C. Griffin Department of Economics at the University of Chicago, where I completed my Ph.D. in 2024.

My research lies at the intersection of public finance and urban economics, with a focus on property taxation and the spatial structure of local governments in the United States. I also develop econometric methods for identifying and estimating causal parameters that are directly relevant to empirical questions in local public finance.
